**Installing Dependencies & Environment Setup**

**Frontend Setup**

1.  Navigate to the project root directory (mobile-tech-prep1) and run:
   
    *   npm install
  
    *   npx expo install expo-constants
      
2.  Open app.json:
    
    *   Scroll down to the extra section.
        
    *   Replace the x.x placeholder with your local IP address and save the file.
        
3.  Create a .env file also in the root directory with the following content and save the file:

    *   API_BASE_URL=http://192.168.x.x:3000 (replace x.x with your address)
    

**Backend Setup**

1.  Navigate to the backend directory in a split/new terminal (cd backend) and run:
   
    *   npm install
  
2.  Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following content and save the file:
    
    *   DB_HOST=localhost
    *   DB_USER=root (replace with your MySQL username)
    *   DB_PASSWORD=your_password (replace with your MySQL password)
    *   DB_NAME=MobileTechPrep
    *   CORS_ORIGIN=http://192.168.x.x:3000,http://localhost:8081 (replace x.x with your address)
    *   PORT=3000

**Running the Application**

**Step 1: Start the Backend**

1.  On the terminal with the backend directory, run: node server.js
    
    *   You should see the following output:
        
    *   Server is running on http://localhost:3000
        
    *   Successfully connected to MySQL Database
        

**Step 2: Start the Frontend**

1.  On the terminal in the root project directory, run: npx expo start (or npx expo start -c)
    
    *   This will launch the Expo Developer Tools and generate a QR code.
        

**Testing the Application**

**Testing on a Physical iOS Device**

1.  Download the Expo Go app from the App Store.
    
2.  Ensure your computer and iPhone are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
    
3.  Scan the QR code generated by Expo Go.
    
4.  Allow the app to load on your device.
    
    *   **Note:** Response times may be slow. Avoid multiple clicks if there is no immediate feedback.
        

**Testing on an iOS Simulator (macOS only)**

1.  Install Xcode if not already installed.
    
2.  In Expo Developer Tools, click “Run on iOS Simulator.”
